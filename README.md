- emotion-detection : opencv project to detect emotion of people (python project)
We implemented a program that uses a webcam to capture your face and determine whether you were smiling or not. We use openCV computer vision library to preprocess the webcam image, and we use logistic regression algorithm to train on a provided dataset and evaluate the new image.

- smile-face-detector : opencv project to detect smile-face on web platform

- snippet : Image Detection/Recognition/Processing projects using OpenCV
For NDA, I can't upload the whole project, so I upload snippets of some projects.

1) Image.cpp
Image processing Desktop Application (Windows C#, Linux Qt)
2) LineTracker.cpp
Image Detection, Shape Detection Desktop Application using OpenCV (Windows C++, Qt)
3) Vehicle_Counting.cpp
Truck Counting Desktop Application.
This app counts the number of trucks with pictures from IP Cameras.
Used OpenCV on Windows OS.
